# Meta-Path-Based-Random-Walk

**An Attentional Neural Networkfor Personalized Next Location Recommendation** In this paper, we have heard about the random walk model and PageRank algorithms, but now we have to do it by our own, because we need to use the random walk to get the neighbors of each POI to train attention weight **This article details the reproduction idea of the walk model, the code link will be given, the annotation is sufficient will not repeat, of course, there must also be deficiencies, if there are found problems, also hope to put forward in time for modification**

```MPBRW_with_pytorch.py``` is the one that meets our needs. ```MPBRW_with_dict.py```is the slower version.
